           re-binds the gateway's session_key for that home channel via
           ``session_store.switch_session`` so the full role-aware transcript
           replays on the next agent turn.
        4. Forges a synthetic ``MessageEvent`` (``internal=True``) with a
           handoff-notice text and dispatches through the normal gateway
           message pipeline so the agent runs and replies on the platform.
        5. Marks the row ``completed`` (or ``failed`` with ``handoff_error``).

        prints the result to the user.
